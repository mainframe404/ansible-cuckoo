# ansible-cuckoo
Ansible Playbook for installing and configuring [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/)

**This is not production code yet.**

This playbook was inspired by [ezetze's ansible-cuckoo](https://github.com/ezeteze/ansible-cuckoo) with changes to support Cuckoo Sandbox 2.0.6

The playbook is tested on **Ubuntu 14.04 x64**.  

Currently uses Ansible playbook structure with two distinct roles:

-	**Cuckoo**: This role downloads cuckoo version 2.0.6 from official github repository and installs required dependencies. 
-	**Virtualbox**: This role adds the official virtualbox ppa repository for Ubuntu and installs virtualbox.

    **Includes following features**:
       * yara
       * ssdeep
       * suricata
       * volatillity

Additional roles being developed:

-	**KVM**: This role installs and configures KVM.
-	**Postgres**: This role installs and configures PostgreSQL.
-	**Cuckoo-VPN**: This role configures Cuckoo's Per-Analysis Network Routing.

To install cuckoo on a local Ubuntu 14.04 LTS virtual machine clone this repo and issue the following commands:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible && apt-get update
    sudo apt-get â€“y install git ansible 
    git clone https://github.com/mainframe404/ansible-cuckoo
    cd ansible-cuckoo
    sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml --connection=local
